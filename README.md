🚀 Project Overview

The Student Record Management System is a Java-based console application designed to store, manage, and display student information including roll number, name, course, marks, and grade.
It implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, constructors, methods, and encapsulation.

This project fulfills all requirements mentioned in the assignment PDF (OOP concepts, menu-driven program, arrays/ArrayList handling, grade calculation, input/output, constructors, and control flow).
📄 Assignment Source: “Java Programming Lab Assignment 1 – Student Class Design & Basic Operations”


🎯 Objectives

✔ Implement a reusable Student class with fields & methods
✔ Use inheritance (Student extends Person)
✔ Apply constructors (default + parameterized)
✔ Manage student records using an ArrayList
✔ Implement input/output using Scanner
✔ Apply conditional logic for grade calculation
✔ Build a menu-driven console system
✔ Practice OOP design, methods, loops, and collection manipulation

🧩 Features
👨‍🎓 Student Management

Add new student records

Store Roll No, Name, Course, Marks, and Grade

Automatic grade calculation (A, B, C, D)

Display all student records

Simple & clean data structure using ArrayList


🧮 Menu System
===== Student Record Menu =====
1. Add Student
2. Display All Students
3. Exit


Fully interactive, looping until user chooses Exit.
